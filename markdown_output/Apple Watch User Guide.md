## Prevent apps from refreshing in the background

When you switch to a new app, the app you were using doesn't remain open or take up system resources, but it may still 'refresh'-check for updates and new content-in the background.

Refreshing apps in the background can use power. To maximize battery life, you can turn this option off.

1.  Open the Settings app on your Apple Watch.
2.  Go to General &gt; Background App Refresh.
3.  Turn off Background App Refresh to prevent all apps from refreshing. Or scroll down, then turn off refresh for individual apps.

Note: Apps with complications on the current watch face will continue to refresh, even when their background app refresh setting is off.

## Save power when the battery is low

You can put your Apple Watch in Power Reserve mode to stretch the remaining battery power. Your Apple Watch still displays the time, but you can't use apps.

2.  Tap the battery percentage, then drag the Power Reserve slider to the right.
3. Tip: If you have battery-powered devices such as AirPods connected to your Apple Watch through Bluetooth, their remaining charge appears on this screen.
