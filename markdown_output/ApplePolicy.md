## Apple Canada

## Accessibility Standards Policy

## Summary

At Apple we aim to build honest, respectful, and individual relationships with our customers. All customers must receive a high level of customer service. This is not only common courtesy and good customer service it is also the law.

Every business, including Apple, has a certain way of doing things. But sometimes a company's customary or standard way of doing things makes it difficult or impossible for customers with disabilities to purchase or enjoy goods and services.

The purpose of this policy is to meet the requirements of the Accessibility Standards for Customer Service, Ontario Regulation 429/07 under the Accessibility for Ontarian's with Disabilities Act, 2005, ('Regulation 429/07') and applies to the provision of goods and services to the public and/or third parties.

All goods and services provided by Apple Canada (the 'Company') shall be consistent with the principles of dignity, independence, integration and equal opportunity.

## General Principles

In accordance with Regulation 429/07 , this policy addresses the following:

- The Provision of Goods and Services to Persons with Disabilities
- The Use of Assistive Devices
- The Use of Guide Dogs and Service Animals
- The Use of Support Persons
- Notice of Disruptions in Service
- Training
- Customer Feedback
- Notice of Availability and Format of Required Documents

## The Provision of Goods and Services to Persons with Disabilities

Apple Canada will make every reasonable effort to ensure that its policies, practices and procedures are consistent with the principles of dignity, independence, integration and equal opportunity by:

- Ensuring that all customers receive equal opportunity to obtain, use and benefit from Apple Canada's goods and services;

- Allowing customers with both visible and non-visible disabilities to access goods and services in a manner that accommodates their individual needs so long as this does not present a safety risk;
- Using alternative methods, where possible, to ensure that customers with both visible and non-visible disabilities have access to the same services, in the same place and in the same or similar manner; and
- Communicating in a manner that takes into account the customer's disability.

## Assistive Devices

## Customer's Own Assistive Device(s):

Persons with disabilities may use their own assistive devices as required when accessing Apple Canada goods or services.

In cases where the assistive device presents a safety concern or where accessibility might be an issue, other reasonable measures will be used to ensure equal access to goods and services.  For example, open flames and oxygen tanks cannot be near one another.  Therefore, the accommodation of a customer with an oxygen tank may involve ensuring the customer is in a location that would be considered safe for both the customer and the business.

## Apple's Assistive Devices:

Persons with disabilities may also use assistive devices provided by Apple when accessing Apple Canada goods or services.  Assistive devices that can be found in all work locations are Apple's own products.

See http://www.apple.com/accessibility/

Discuss with your manager what additional devices may be available at your specific work location.   If you receive a request to locate a local interpreter, reach out to your Regional Assistant or Human Resources to discuss pricing, payment methods and terms prior to hiring the interpreter. (You should expect to pay no more than $30-$40 per hour.)  The following sites may also be useful:

## Guide Dogs and Service Animals

Customers with disabilities that are accompanied by a guide dog or service animal will be allowed access to Apple Canada premises and will be allowed to keep the animal with him or her unless otherwise excluded by law or the animal has demonstrated a safety threat.

## Support Persons

If a customer with a disability is accompanied by a support person, Apple Canada will ensure that both people are allowed to enter the premises together and that the customer is not prevented from having access to the support person.

There may be times where seating and availability prevent the customer and support person from sitting beside one another.  In these situations, Apple Canada will make every reasonable attempt to resolve the issue.

In situations where confidential information may be discussed, a non disclosure agreement may be required for the support person, prior to the discussion.
